# CHALLENGE 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor - Accessibility

## Description

The challenge is on-the-job ticket, which means you begin with starter code that
needs to be refactored (refactor code is to improve it without changing what it
does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. It
involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration nowadays. It
ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive
technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of
them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like
Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with
disabilities cannot access their website.

## Installation

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

1. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`
   commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the
   Settings tab on the right side of the page.

1. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the
   section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

1. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you
   will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub
   username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL
   would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your
> site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check
> that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing.
> GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause
> problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of
your app!

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](../Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that
> some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than
> 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your
> web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Requirements

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing
the following:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code;
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and
  positioning;
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes;
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order;
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title;
- All links are functioning correctly.
- Rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and
  properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML
  elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
